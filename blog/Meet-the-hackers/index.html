<h2>title: Meet the Hackers: Do your sales teams know your developers?
date_created: 4th of August, 2015
author_name: Susana Lopes</h2>
<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p>You can use hackathons to make awesome developers
stand out and get company-wide recognition.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the challenges of distributed teams is people
having a hard time associating faces with names. I am sure
that none of our sales reps in California know the name of more than
two developers, maybe they don’t even know one.</p>
<p>Releases and features are seen as coming from this one engineering entity.
It’s always a group effort and the individuals responsible for
great achievements are hidden behind the team. The reverse happens in
sales department. Individual achievements are celebrated each month.
Though not everyone might have spoken to the highest performing sales
people, their names and their faces are known.</p>
<p>A hackathon is a great opportunity to introduce your developers to
the company, have them thrive in the (temporary) competitive spirit
and at the end highlight and celebrate their (really hacky) achievements.</p>
<p>During last year’s Huddle Hackathon I experimented a bit with this idea.
In addition to the exposure the developers got when presenting and demoing
their finished hacks I thought it would be fun to do something a bit silly
(mostly inspired by the NeverBland Silicon Christmas party
<a href="http://siliconchristmas.com/photobooth.html">photo booth</a>).</p>
<p>I brought in all the ridiculous hats, feather boas, fake moustaches,
magnifying glasses, waistcoats, and other crazy accessories I had lying
around my house (and believe me, I had a surprising amount)
to put together a Hackathon photo booth.</p>
<p>We got a photo taken for each Hack team and then sent it around the
office together with a ridiculous fact in a <em>Meet the Hackers</em> email series.
Here’s a selection of them:</p>
<div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">
    <div style="float: left; width: 58%; top: 100px">
      <img src="img/2015-08-04-Meet-the-hackers/jon-harry.jpg"/>
      <p class="caption"><b>Team Continuity</b>: Jon likes giraffes. Harry thinks piña coladas are all right.</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;img src=&quot;img/2015-08-04-Meet-the-hackers/james-deniz-emily.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team Who’s Viewing&lt;/b&gt;: James regularly cries during Disney films. Deniz's fear of heights is slightly greater than his fear of watching other people doing things high off the ground. Emily hates runny eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 60%; position: absolute; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/2015-08-04-Meet-the-hackers/ian-dan.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team Data&lt;/b&gt;: Ian thinks Merman was infinitely superior to HeMan. Daniel has a constant craving for a Prawn Biryani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p style="clear: both">
I’m not sure any San Fran sales peeps are likely to still remember how scared
of heights Deniz is, but they did get a few laughs out of it,
and maybe they recognized his face during his hack demo.
